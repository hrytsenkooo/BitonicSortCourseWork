# Bitonic Sort - Parallel Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of **Bitonic Sort** using **parallel programming** in C# using the **Task Parallel Library (TPL)** for my courserwok.

## Algorithm description
**Bitonic Sort** is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses **sorting networks** and is ideally suited for parallel execution. It works by recursively dividing an array into **bitonic sequences**, which are then merged into a sorted array.

## Technologies used
- **C#**, **.NET**
- **Task Parallel Library (TPL)** for multithreading

## Launch the project

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hrytsenkooo/BitonicSortCourseWork

# Change directory
cd BitonicSortCourseWork

# Run in Visual Studio or via .NET CLI
dotnet run
```
